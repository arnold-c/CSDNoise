- `method::EWSMethod`: The windowing method (Backward or Centered) for EWS calculations
- `aggregation::Dates.Day`: Time period for aggregating raw data before EWS calculation

## Time Series Metrics
- `mean::Vector{Float64}`: Rolling mean values over time

- `skewness::Vector{Float64}`: Rolling skewness values over time
- `kurtosis::Vector{Float64}`: Rolling kurtosis values over time
- `autocovariance::Vector{Float64}`: Rolling lag-1 autocovariance over time
- `autocorrelation::Vector{Float64}`: Rolling lag-1 autocorrelation over time

## Trend Statistics (Kendall's Tau)
- `mean_tau::Float64`: Kendall's tau for the mean time series trend
- `variance_tau::Float64`: Kendall's tau for the variance time series trend
- `coefficient_of_variation_tau::Float64`: Kendall's tau for the CV time series trend

closer to Â±1 indicating stronger monotonic trends. Positive tau values suggest increasing
trends (potential early warning signals), while negative values suggest decreasing trends.
